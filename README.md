# Entropy-State-Oxford-2025
Entropy-State-Oxford-2025 provides a fully reproducible pipeline for extracting thermodynamic entropy flow from raw waveform measurements of the Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset.

The repository implements:

- Raw entropy extraction from voltage, charge, and temperature (σ = V·I/T)
- Cycle-level cumulative entropy computation
- Entropy Aging Rate (EAR) regression
- Curvature-based Entropy Stability Index (ESI)
- Thermodynamic health geometry and surface construction

This code accompanies the paper:
"Entropy-State Representation and Thermodynamic Health Geometry for Lithium-Ion Battery Aging."

The focus of this repository is reproducibility, physical interpretability, and thermodynamically consistent degradation analysis.
